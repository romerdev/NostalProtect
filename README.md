# NostalProtect

 Instantly protect your Minecraft world with easy to use permissions! Such as:
 
 - `np.block.STONE.place`
 - `np.item.GRASS.pickup`
 - `np.entity.ARMOR_STAND.interact`
 
 And with the [Worldguard integration](https://github.com/romerdev/NostalProtect/wiki/WorldGuard-integration) you could even specify the region.


## Installation

Place this plugin and a permission manager, such as [Luckperms](https://luckperms.net), in your plugin folder and (re)start the server. Your world is now protected! That was easy, huh?
